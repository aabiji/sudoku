tiny mini project: learn some basic computer vision techniques
Sudoku solver from image.
    - Scale and convert image to greyscale
    - Apply adaptive gaussian binary thresholding
    - Apply Canny edge detection
    - Use Hough Lines algorithm to detect lines
    - Crop sudoku cells using detected lines
    - Use digit OCR to populate in memory sudoku board representation
    - Pass sudoku board to the sudoku solver
Using OpenCV to parse the sudoku board from the image.
Plan to solve the sudoku puzzle.
Plan to write a simple Tkinter GUI around it.
